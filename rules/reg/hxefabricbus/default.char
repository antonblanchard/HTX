**This rule attempts to saturate fabricbus connecting nodes, Remote node memory is exercised by [0-1] threads of every core.
**Only one segment will be exercised by each cpu and it is filled with 9 different patterns.
**Please read the documnetation hxefabricbus.readme_P9 for explaination of rule parameters.
