* 	16MB and 16GB pages are always pinned memory. 
* 	16 MB pages may not be enabled by default on system. You may have to run
* 	'vmo' command to enable 16 MB large pages.
*
*	vmo -p -o lgpg_regions=<no of pages> -o lgpg_size=<page size>
*
*	You will also need to run bosboot -a after executing vmo command.
*	You can verify with svmon -G command if large page pool is enabled.
*	64K page size is supported by processor version GSDD2.0 and later 
*	processors based hardware and AIX53E or later.
